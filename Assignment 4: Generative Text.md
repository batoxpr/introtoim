# **ASSIGNMENT 4 - GENERATIVE TEXT on P5.JS** ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”®âœ¨ #
Here's the [link](https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/full/BhxH4QVfa) to my Assignment 4: Generative text! 
Along with the [Code Link](https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/sketches/BhxH4QVfa)

Initial Idea: To make some sort of text that looks dope. I wanted to write a simple code that achieves an effortless aesthetic.
Inspiration: Emo culture, Donnie Darko, and the lyrics "Hello darkness my old friend", text emojis.

Process: I chose a minimal font named 'SpaceGrotesk' from the GoogleFonts. Preloaded it. I used textToPoints to make an array of text points for my string. I set the samplefactor to 0.25 for more density. Then I made a loop using the array length and created multiple shapes within the loop.

The strokeWeight of the line increases until it hits 5. This is for the gradual darkness effect - which symbolizes how life can go dark in a simple turn of events. 
The rectangle is for the glitchy effect - which shows how imperfections can find a certain balance to look perfect. 
The vertex shape makes the text look like it was sewn with a thread.

Overall, the concept is about how darkness or dark times are an integral part of life and how we should embrace them with open arms to learn a lesson from them, hence the text "hello darkness'.

Learnings, Next steps - I had many different ideas for making cool generative texts, but eventually ended up settling on the simple one. For my mid-term, I want to create something more daring and ambitious.

Regardless, it was a good practice for making use of various topics we've learn in class.
