# **ASSIGNMENT 4 - GENERATIVE TEXT on P5.JS** ðŸŽ¨#
Here's the [link](https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/full/BhxH4QVfa) to my Assignment 4: Generative text! 
Along with the [Code Link](https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/sketches/BhxH4QVfa)

Initial Idea: To make some sort of text that looks dope. I wanted write a simple code that achieves aesthetically wanted it to still look aesthetically pleasing.
Inspiration: Emo culture, Donnie Darko, and the lyrics "Hello darkness my old friend"

Process: I chose a minimal font named 'SpaceGrotesk' from the GoogleFonts. Preloaded it. I used textToPoints and made an array of text points for my string. I set the samplefactor to 0.3 for more density. Then I made a loop using the array length and created multiple shapes within the loop. The strokeWeight of line increases until it hits 5. The rectangle is for the glitchy looking effect. The vertex shape makes the text look like it was sewn with a thread.

Learnings, Next steps  - I had many different ideas for making generative texts, but eventually ended up settling on the simple one. For my mid-term, I want to create something more daring and ambitious.

Regardless, it was a good practice for making use of various topics we've learn in class.
