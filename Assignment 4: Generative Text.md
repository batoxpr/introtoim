# **ASSIGNMENT 4 - GENERATIVE TEXT on P5.JS** ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”®âœ¨ #
Here's the [link](https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/full/BhxH4QVfa) to my Assignment 4: Generative text! 
Along with the [Code Link](https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/sketches/BhxH4QVfa)

Initial Idea: To make some sort of text that looks dope. I wanted write a simple code that achieves aesthetic.
Inspiration: Emo culture, Donnie Darko, and the lyrics "Hello darkness my old friend", text emojis.

Process: I chose a minimal font named 'SpaceGrotesk' from the GoogleFonts. Preloaded it. I used textToPoints to make an array of text points for my string. I set the samplefactor to 0.3 for more density. Then I made a loop using the array length and created multiple shapes within the loop. The strokeWeight of the line increases until it hits 5. This is for a gradual darkness effect - which symbolizes how life can go dark in a simple turn of events. The rectangle is for the glitchy looking effect. The vertex shape makes the text look like it was sewn with a thread.

Learnings, Next steps  - I had many different ideas for making generative texts, but eventually ended up settling on the simple one. For my mid-term, I want to create something more daring and ambitious.

Regardless, it was a good practice for making use of various topics we've learn in class.
