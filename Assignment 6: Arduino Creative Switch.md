# **ASSIGNMENT 6 - CREATIVE LED Switch with ARDUINO** ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”®âœ¨ #
This week's assignment was to create a creative LED switch for an arduino curcuit.

First, I remade the same curcuit we built in class. I used the black and red wires, resistor, and an LED light.
Resistor is the 1/4 Watt, 330 ohm, and carbon film one. I could indicate this through the color code of Orange, Orange, Brown and Gold.
To place the 

For the conductor, I had to find some object made of copper, gold, silver, gold. In practice, anything that transmits electricity could have worked. First I was trying to use the soda can I had on my desk, but it wasn't quite working as I expected. Then I found a few one dirham coins in my backpack. According to a quick Google search, The 1 UAE dirham piece is made of nickel plated steel and features a jug and Arabic text. As a matter of convenience, I decided to use the coins. I added new wires to my circuit and taped them to my coins. This time, as expected, the circuit was working perfectly fine. I believe this is because the dirham coins are made of whole materials without anything else mixed in. Therefore, they are an example of an effective electricity conductor.
