# **ASSIGNMENT 6 - CREATIVE LED Switch with ARDUINO** ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”®âœ¨ #
This week's assignment was to create a creative LED switch for an arduino curcuit.

First, I remade the same curcuit we built in class. I used the black and red wires, resistor, and an LED light.
Resistor is the 1/4 Watt, 330 ohm, and carbon film one. I could indicate this through the color code of Orange, Orange, Brown and Gold.
I placed the LED on the board matching the long leg with the positive side and the short leg with the opposite one. I've found out that the long leg is named anode (+) and the short leg is named

For the conductor, I had to find some object made of copper, gold, silver, gold. In practice, anything that transmits electricity could have worked. First I was trying to use the soda can I had on my desk, but it wasn't quite working as I expected. Then I found a few one dirham coins in my backpack. According to a quick Google search, The 1 UAE dirham piece is made of nickel plated steel and features a jug and Arabic text. As a matter of convenience, I decided to use the coins. I added new wires to my circuit and taped them to my coins. This time, as expected, the circuit was working perfectly fine. I believe this is because the dirham coins are made of whole materials without anything else mixed in. Therefore, they are an example of an effective electricity conductor.
