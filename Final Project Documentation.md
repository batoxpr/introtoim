///**design concept & ideas**///

- After thinking over the UI design, We decided to stick with two primary colors (warm pastel yellow (252, 238, 184) and white (255,255,255) for the clean minimalistic look. 


- We designed the Panda logo on iPad's Procreate app. First we made a rough sketch of the panda, and followed up with more layers to polish.

- We chose Helvetica Oblique and Million Dreams as our main two fonts. Since Million Dreams was the fancier one, we used that for the Logo and Menu options.
Helvetica, on the other hand, is neat and easy on the eyes, so we thought it was a good choice for directions and instructions.

- We designed all of our assets on Adobe XD and laid it out accordingly on the P5JS. In this process, Adobe XD's coordinate function helped us greatly in finding the right placements for the assets. For the shapes of our assets, we mainly sticked to rounded corners instead of sharper ones, which resulted in softer-looking aesthetic.

- For our background, we used a plain white background layered with stretch of tiles. This is a prominent design choice reminiscent of 2014 Tumblr era.

- We added triple heart detail on every page to complete the design. To make the hearts float and blink, we usec Framecount function.
