///**design concept & ideas**///

After thinking over the UI design, We decided to stick with two primary colors for the clean minimalistic look. 
Pastel yellow (255, 252, 156) and White (255,255,255).

We designed the logo on iPad's Procreate app. First we made a rough sketch of the panda, and added more layers to polish later on.

We chose Helvetica Oblique and Million Dreams as main two fonts. Since Million Dreams was the fancier one, we used that for the Logo and Menu options.
Helvetica, on the other hand, is neat and easy on the eyes so we thought it was a good choice for directions and instructions.

We designed all of our assets on Adobe XD and laid it out accordingly on the P5JS. In this process, Adobe XD's coordinate function helped us greatly in finding the right placements for the assets.
