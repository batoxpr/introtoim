# **ASSIGNMENT 1 - SELF PORTRAIT USING P5.JS** üñºÔ∏è #

## Here's the [link](https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/full/btjEvcjxf) to my Assignment 1: Self-portrait!
along with the [Code Link](https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/sketches/btjEvcjxf) ##

To draw each shape, I first used a rough code with random parameter values. 
Then I modified the values to achieve more accurate shapes. Over time, this approach gave a good estimate of which point falls under which area of the canvas.
I made use of following shape functions: ellipse, arc, rectangle, and point
While the features are not exactly true to reality, I'm somehow satisfied with the end results.

The part I struggled with the most is the mouth part. When I made myself smile, it looked creepy because of the mismatch between the mouth and the eyes. 
To avoid this hysteric appearance, I left the mouth as a normal ellipse. 

However, I added a special Framework animation that makes me look like I'm blowing a Bubble gum. **That's why I named the portrait "Bubblegum"**
To see the animation, please uncomment the **SPECIAL ANIMATION** part of the code. Although it wasn't a requirement, I believe it made the drawing more fun. 

It took around 2-3 hours to fully finish the drawing. Overall, it was a great practice for making use of various drawing functions of the P5 library.

For the shape codes, I used the class documentation from Github as well as the [Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) page of the P5 Library site.
For the Gradient background I used the lerpColor function refering to [this example](https://editor.p5js.org/Jaemi13/sketches/gAS-FB5Sx).
