/*ASSIGNMENT 1 - SELF PORTRAIT USING P5.JS*/

It took around 2-3 hours to fully finish drawing this.
Overall, it was a great practice for making use of the various shape functions of the P5 library.
For each layer/object of the drawing, I first created a rough shape with random values, then modified the values afterwards for more accuracy.
Over time, this approach gave a good estimate of which point falls under which area of the canvas.
