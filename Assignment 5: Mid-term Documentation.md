CYBORG.IO - A CYBORG MAKEOVER GAME.
Inspired by the late 2000's dress-up/makeover games from sites like y8.com

BACKGROUND STORY
The story takes place in an alternate universe where cyborgs and humans can communicate with each other through a website named ‚Äúcyborg.io‚Äù 
The player is a human who is a user of this website. On the website, the player has become friends with a particular cyborg ‚Äú247.‚Äù The cyborg lives on a planet called ‚ÄúJubilee‚Äù. 
The cyborg comes to the earth to visit their friend. During the long intergalactic travel to the earth, the cyborg‚Äôs body parts are damaged and wounded. The player‚Äôs mission is to help fix their friend and rehabilitate them to function properly on the earth.

DESIGN
- The cyborg will have a heart shaped device named ‚ÄúElectra‚Äù that will help them express their emotions and communicate with humans. 
- The cyborg will have animtated wi-fi signal coming from the top of their head.  
- The cyborg will consist of a head, main body, hands, and legs ‚Äì which all vaguely resemble human body. 
- On the head, it‚Äôll have three eyes, round nose, mouth, and elf shaped ears. 

LEVEL 1; REHABILITATION
Challenges: To fix the arm with screwdriver, add bandaid to the wounds, eyedrop?

LEVEL 2; MAKEOVER
Possibilities: Changeable eye shape?, Changeable Eye color? Changeable ear shape? Outfits?

Process: I have the first sketch at the moment. I'm borrowing an iPad from the Equipment Center on Monday the 28th. I'll start working on the visuals quickly. However, If I conclude that I won't be able to finish this in time ~ I;ll go for a simpler idea with the same concept like [the following one](https://sweaters.itch.io/birdcreator){:target="_blank"}

Update 2# So far, I only have the (following)[https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/sketches/mkPuaCvwf] code. It contains the basic functionalities of the game. 
I'm aware that the code is not so effective as it repeats the same lines many times. I plan to implement arrays and classes soon to get the game fully finished over the weekend. I plan to have the final version ready on Tuesday and I'll add extra touches based on the feedback.
