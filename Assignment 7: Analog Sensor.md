# **ASSIGNMENT 7 - Analog Sensor with ARDUINO** ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”®âœ¨ #
This week's assignment was to build an Arduino circuit consisting of Analog and Digital components.

In class, we have learned about the Analog input - specifically the Potentometer and Light sensor.
Based on that, I wanted to think of a creative way of using the Potentometer as a controller.


Digital Write - Digital Output - LEDs turn on when the Potentometer hits a certain point.
Analog Read - Analog Input - 
If and Else If conditionals
