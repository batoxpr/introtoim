# **ASSIGNMENT 7 - Analog Sensor with ARDUINO** ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”®âœ¨ #
This week's assignment was to build a circuit on Arduino, making use of the Digital and Analog components.

In class, we have learned about the Analog input - specifically the Potentometer and Light sensor.
Based on that, I wanted to think of a creative way of using the Potentometer as a controller.
After some research, I figured out that I can use the Potentometer's input value  and use that value to assign certain functions to it.



Digital Write - Digital Output - LEDs turn on when the Potentometer hits a certain point.
Analog Read - Analog Input - 
If and Else If conditionals
