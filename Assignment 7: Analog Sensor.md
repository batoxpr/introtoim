# **ASSIGNMENT 7 - Analog Sensor with ARDUINO** ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”®âœ¨ #
This week's assignment was to build a circuit on Arduino, making use of the Digital and Analog components.

**/Initial Idea**

In class, we have learned about the Analog input - specifically the Potentometer and Light sensor.
Based on that experience, I wanted to think of a creative way of using the Potentometer as a controller.
After some research, I figured out that I can use the Potentometer's input value and use that measure to assign functionalities.

**/Setting up the circuit**

To implement this possibility, I decided to use the value of Potentometer to control 4 array of LED lights. 
Maximum possible value of the Potentometer is 1024, which means it'd be 256, 512, 768, and 1024 respectively when divided by 4.
I wanted the LEDs to light up in this order, one after another as we tune the knob.

To achieve this, I first set 4 LEDs in array, connecting the short legs to 330 ohm resistors, and long legs to the positive wires. 
Each wire is in different color representive of the matching LED colors. All 4 wires are connected to different digital outputs on the board.

After this, I set the Potentometer on the other side of the breadboard. While I connected the left leg to the ground, right leg was connected to the positive. The middle leg is connected to the A5 analog input, distinctive by its white wire. 

**/Coding process**

Digital Write - Digital Output - LEDs turn on when the Potentometer hits a certain point.
Analog Read - Analog Input - 
If and Else If conditionals
