# **ASSIGNMENT 7 - Analog Sensor with ARDUINO** ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”®âœ¨ #
This week's assignment was to create a Arduino circuit consisting of Analog and Digital components.

In class, we have learned about the Analog input - specifically the Potentometer and Light sensor.
Based on that, I wanted to think of a creative way of using the Potentometer as a controller.
