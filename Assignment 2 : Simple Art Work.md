# **ASSIGNMENT 2 - SIMPLE ARTWORK USING P5.JS** üñºÔ∏è #

Here's the [link](https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/full/d4SKrEauQ) to my Assignment 2: Loop Artwork! 
Along with the [Code Link](https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/sketches/d4SKrEauQ)

The background was intentionally made black with low opacity so we can see the trace of the moving shapes.
By using the the "for loop" function, I repeated a heartshape multiple times. For the fill of the shape, I used random function to manifest more colorful background.
By changing the values of the vertex to mouseX and mouseY, I managed to achieved the glitchy rainbow effect that follows the mouse.

For the moving circle, I first declared a simple t variable 0. Then I used that variable along with the noise function to move the center coordinates of the circle as well as to change the colors gradually. This resulted in a smooth movement and change of colors.

Overall, it was a great practice for making use of various drawing functions of the P5 library.
