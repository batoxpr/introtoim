So far, I only have the (following)[https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/sketches/mkPuaCvwf] code. It contains the basic functionalities of the game. 
I'm aware that the code is not so effective as it repeats the same lines many times. I plan to implement arrays and classes soon to get the game fully finished over the weekend. I plan to have the final version ready on Tuesday and I'll add extra touches based on the feedback. 

I'll also think of a challenge or a gameplay. So it feels more like a game..

**March 5th!**
After getting a feedback on the dressup game idea, I decided to go for a completely different concept. The new game will be a "shoot 'em up" arcade game based on the classic Space Invaders. The name of the game will be "Emoji war" and It'll be a battle between Heart-eye emoji and Evil face emojis. The characters will be animated. Because I realized that there should be some sort of gameplay or challenge to it, I'm going for this concept.
