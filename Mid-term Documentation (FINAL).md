So far, I only have the (following)[https://editor.p5js.org/batoxpr/sketches/mkPuaCvwf] code. It contains the basic functionalities of the game. 
I'm aware that the code is not so effective as it repeats the same lines many times. I plan to implement arrays and classes soon to get the game fully finished over the weekend. I plan to have the final version ready on Tuesday and I'll add extra touches based on the feedback. 

I'll also think of a challenge or a gameplay. So it feels more like a game..

**March 5th!**

After getting a feedback on the dressup game idea, I decided to go for a completely different concept. The new game will be a "shoot 'em up" arcade game based on the classic Space Invaders. The name of the game will be "Emoji war" and It'll be a battle between Heart-eye emoji and Evil face emojis. The characters will be animated. Because I realized that there should be some sort of gameplay or challenge to it, I'm going for this concept.

//**ASSETS**

For the font, I've found the following from GoogleFonts library. I wanted to go for a pixelated retro gaming theme. Therefore it fits well.
For the sounds, I;ve found the following:
(game over)https://freesound.org/people/myfox14/sounds/382310/
(win)https://freesound.org/people/Leszek_Szary/sounds/171671/

//**START SCREEN**

For the background image, I've found a pixelated sky gif from google. 
For the moving title, I made something similar to the example you included in the Week 5 Github.
For the blinking insruction text, I've used framecount and modulus to make it blink.
